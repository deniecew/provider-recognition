# Provider Recognition Program

## Moffitt Cancer Center - Patient Experience Department

### Overview

This is an automated sort, filter, and distribution process that takes positive provider-specific comments, sorts them in order of priority, and then distributes them to the provider in a visually appealing graphic. The steps are as follows:

-   import third-party survey comments
-   perform sentiment analysis to filter positive comments
-   extract positive comments with the named provider
-   verify provider/resource match to comment names
-   use the sentiment score to sort matched comments by provider
-   Combine into a visual that can be sent to the provider

Image was developed in Copilot using Moffitt's official brand colors: Catalina Blue (#062F6E) for the background, Bondi Blue (#028DB4) for the rays and accents, and Spindle (#B5E1ED) for the central speech bubble.
