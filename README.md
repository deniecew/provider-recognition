This was a project that is modeled after the 'Exceptional Jo' program at Vanderbilt Health.  Originally it was a Hackathon 2024 project.

The goal is to automatically sort through patient provided survey comments and filter out those that are positive, have a named provider, and are rated exceptional.  

These comments are then sent to the provider directly.
