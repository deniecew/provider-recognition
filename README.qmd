# Provider Recognition Program

### Moffitt Cancer Center - Patient Experience Department

## Overview

This is an automated process that sorts, filters, and distributes positive provider-specific comments in order of priority, presenting them to the provider in a visually appealing graphic. The steps are as follows:

-   import third-party survey comments
-   perform sentiment analysis to filter positive comments
-   extract positive comments with the named provider
-   verify provider/resource match to comment names
-   use the sentiment score to sort matched comments by provider
-   combine into a visual that can be sent to the provider

### **Steps to Generate ShoutOut Cards**

1.  **Download Source Data**

-   Download the daily source data from the semantic model (**Important:** Only download **one day’s worth of data**.)

<!-- -->

-   Save the file in the working folder as **`commentdata.csv`**.

2.  **Open the Project**

-   Open **`provider-recognition.Rproj`**.

-   The following files should automatically load:

    -   `README.qmd`

    -   `cardtemplate.qmd`

    -   `render.R`

-   If they do not load automatically, manually open them by clicking on each file in the project folder while the project is open.

3.  **Run the Render Script**

-   Open the **`render.R`** tab.

-   Highlight all the code and click **Run**.

-   This will:

    -   Generate all ShoutOut cards as an **HTML page**.

    -   Append the current run’s list of shoutouts to **`summarytable.csv`**.

4.  **Share the Cards**

-   Move the generated HTML files from the **code** folder to the main **ShoutOut** folder for provider access. (optional)

<!-- -->

-   Send the ShoutOut cards at HTML attachment.
