# Provider Recognition Program

### Moffitt Cancer Center - Patient Experience Department

## Overview

This is an automated process that sorts, filters, and distributes positive provider-specific comments in order of priority, presenting them to the provider in a visually appealing graphic. The steps are as follows:

-   import third-party survey comments
-   perform sentiment analysis to filter positive comments
-   extract positive comments with the named provider
-   verify provider/resource match to comment names
-   use the sentiment score to sort matched comments by provider
-   combine into a visual that can be sent to the provider
